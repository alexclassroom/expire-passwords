Harden the security of your site by preventing unauthorized access to stale user accounts.

This plugin is also ideal for sites needing to meet certain industry security compliances - such as government, banking or healthcare.

In the plugin settings you can set the maximum number of days users are allowed to use the same password (90 days by default), as well as which user roles will be required to reset their passwords regularly (non-Administrators by default).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What happens to existing users when I first install the plugin? =

Existing users are **not** immediately expired. The plugin tracks each user's last password reset date. Users who have never reset their password have no recorded date, so they are treated as not expired. The expiration clock only starts once a user registers or resets their password after the plugin is active.

= How can I hide the settings page from certain roles? =

The plugin provides a `eup_submenu_access` filter to control which capability is required to see the settings page. By default it requires `manage_options`. To restrict it to only administrators, add this to your theme's `functions.php`:

`add_filter( 'eup_submenu_access', function() { return 'manage_network'; } );`

Or use any capability that only your desired role has. This is useful when custom roles have `manage_options` for other purposes but should not access the Expire User Passwords settings.

= What is the default password expiration period? =

The default is 90 days. You can change this in Settings > Expire Passwords to any value between 1 and 365 days.

= Which user roles are affected by default? =

By default, all non-Administrator roles are required to reset their passwords. You can customize which roles are affected in the plugin settings.

= Can users reuse their old password? =

No. When a user's password expires and they are prompted to reset it, they cannot use the same password they had before.

= What PHP and WordPress versions are supported? =

The plugin requires PHP 8.1 or higher and has been tested up to WordPress 6.9.1. It requires WordPress 4.0 at minimum.

= What languages are supported? =

The plugin is available in 50 languages!

== Screenshots ==

1. Configure which user roles should be required to regularly reset their passwords and how often.
2. Users with expired passwords are redirected to the password reset screen upon sign in.
3. Users are not permitted to use the same password two times in a row during reset.
